# GAN_model_generate_images
The project is currently under work and improvement
GAN model which consists of a generator and discriminator that try to generate artificial images
Currently experimenting on the GAN model with images dataset of dogs from kaggle.
The first results images are currently not as expected - being low resolution and smeared, and do not resemble dogs at the moment, which means more adjustments are required to the model.
